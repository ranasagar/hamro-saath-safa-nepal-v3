## 🎯 What's Blocking You

Your error was:
```
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/ranasagar/hamro-saath-safa-nepal-v3.git/' not found
```

**Why?** The GitHub repository hasn't been created yet.

**Solution?** Create it now at https://github.com/new

---

## ⚡ Quick Action Steps

### Step 1️⃣: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

A browser tab has been opened at `https://github.com/new`

**On that page:**

1. **Fill in repository name**
   ```
   Repository name: hamro-saath-safa-nepal-v3
   ```

2. **CRITICAL - Uncheck these boxes:**
   ```
   ☐ Initialize this repository with a README
   ☐ Add .gitignore
   ☐ Choose a license
   ☐ Add a .gitattributes file
   ☐ Enable Wikis
   ```

3. **Leave these as default:**
   ```
   ✓ Public (for community project)
   ✓ No template
   ```

4. **Click "Create repository" button**

---

### Step 2️⃣: Come Back and Tell Me (30 seconds)

Once the repository is created, you'll see a screen like:

```
Quick setup — if you've done this kind of thing before

Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. 
We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and 
.gitignore.
```

**Confirm to me that you see this screen**, then I'll help you push your code.
