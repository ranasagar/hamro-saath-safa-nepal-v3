# Privacy & Data Retention (Draft)

Purpose: provide a minimal policy covering personal data handling, retention, and deletion for the platform.

Principles
- Collect the minimum personal data required for service (name, ward, avatar, contact optional).
- Use clear consent during onboarding for location & photos.
- Allow users to make profile fields public/private.

Data Retention
- Transaction and ledger data: retain for 7 years for audit (local laws may vary).
- Images: retain for 2 years by default; partners may request longer retention for reconciliations.
- Account data: retained until user requests deletion; on deletion, anonymize personal identifiers but keep ledger entries for audit.

Data Deletion & Export
- Provide a data export endpoint (owner authenticated) to download user data in machine-readable format.
- Provide a deletion request flow that anonymizes or removes personal data while preserving audit trails where legally required.

Compliance
- Note: this is a draft. Consult local legal counsel for Nepal-specific privacy and records retention laws.
